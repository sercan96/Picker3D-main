<h1 align="center">Picker3D</h1>
<h3 align="center">This project is a replication of the game Picker 3D. I prioritized two key aspects throughout the development of this project. Firstly, I aimed to recreate the same immersive gaming experience found in the original game, ensuring that players feel the excitement of collecting the balls. Secondly, I placed a strong emphasis on maintaining a clean and modular code structure for the project. To achieve this, I adhered to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Driven Programming (EDP) principles. This approach allows for the swift integration of new ball shapes, obstacles, or bonus objects into the project, enhancing its versatility and expandability.</h3>
